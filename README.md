# Principle of Computer Science Labs and Assignments (Java)

Welcome to the principle-of-com-sci repository! This repository contains lab exercises and assignments related to the principles of computer science implemented in Java. Each lab exercise is organised into folders named "topic 1" through "topic 10", and there are two assignment folders. Additionally, zip files of each folder are provided for easy download and distribution.

## Lab Exercises

The lab exercises are divided into ten topics, covering various fundamental concepts in computer science. Each topic folder contains materials related to the respective lab exercise, including Java code examples, documentation, and supplementary resources. Feel free to explore these folders to review concepts or practice coding exercises.

## Assignments 

Two assignment folders, are included in this repository. These assignments are designed to test my understanding of the principles dicussed throughout the course. Each assignment folder contains detailed instructions, specifications, and any necessary files required to complete the assignments. Be sure to refer to these folders for guidelines on completing and submitting your assignments.

## Getting Started
